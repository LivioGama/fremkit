# Themes

A theme is the palette, the fonts and the text size of everything Fremkit draws: the dashboard,
the navigation bar, the editor, and the widgets themselves. It is a folder with one JSON file, the
same shape a widget install takes, so yours lives beside the built-in ones and never collides with
them when you pull.

```
themes/
  fremkit/theme.json    the built-in theme: graphite and sand
  edge/theme.json       anodised graphite, cream legends, larger text, no tile cards
  mine/theme.json       yours
```

Two ship, for the same reason eighteen widgets do: what is in the checkout is what a fresh
install needs with no network at all. Four more — `nuit`, `brume`, `terminal` and `papier` — are
on the registry; see [Themes from the registry](#themes-from-the-registry) below.

Pick one in the editor: **Screen** → **Theme**. The dashboard repaints at once, the editor with
it, so what you see while arranging tiles is what the screen shows. ⟳ next to the list rereads the
folder, exactly like the widget library's.

## A theme for the night

Under the theme list, **Another theme at night** picks a second theme and when it takes over. The
first one becomes the day theme. The switch follows the same day and night as a screen's
brightness (**Screen** → **Brightness**): sunrise and sunset at a place, found with a city search
or typed as coordinates, or two fixed times on the Mac's clock. When a screen's brightness already
knows its place, the night theme starts from it, and a button offers it again if you change it.
Unlike the brightness there is no ramp: the theme changes at once, crossfaded on the screen.

The server decides which theme is in force and tells every page on the `theme` channel, so the
Edge, the editor, a paired iPad and every widget switch together, and a page opened at night is
painted with the night theme from the start. Sun times are computed on the Mac; the only network
call is the city search, made when you press Search. A night theme whose folder is gone is painted
as the built-in theme, like a missing day theme.

In `data/fremkit.json` it is one optional key beside `theme`, absent unless you turned it on:

```json
"theme": "fremkit",
"themeSchedule": { "night": "edge", "schedule": "sun", "latitude": 48.8566, "longitude": 2.3522, "dayAt": "07:00", "nightAt": "21:00" }
```

`schedule` is `sun` (with `latitude` and `longitude`) or `fixed` (with `dayAt` and `nightAt`, 24-hour
`HH:MM`). A `sun` schedule with no place yet keeps the day theme, and the editor says why.

## theme.json

```json
{
  "id": "mine",
  "name": { "fr": "Le mien", "en": "Mine" },
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": { "fr": "Bleu nuit", "en": "Midnight blue" },
  "tokens": {
    "bg": "#0a1020",
    "surface": "#111a2e",
    "accent": "#5fa8ff",
    "text-scale": 1.2
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Matches the folder name, `[a-z0-9_-]+` |
| `name` | yes | Shown in the theme list; one string, or a `{ fr, en }` pair |
| `version` | yes | Semver, `1.0.0` |
| `description` | no | One line under the list |
| `tokens` | no | The values this theme changes; everything else keeps the built-in theme's |

A theme only has to name what it changes: the values it leaves out come from `fremkit`, so a
five-line theme that moves the accent and the background is a complete theme.

## The tokens

Colours are `#rgb`, `#rrggbb` or `#rrggbbaa`. Lengths are `px`, `rem` or `em`. A shadow is
offsets, a blur, a spread and a colour — `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, `hsla()` and nothing else,
since these values end up in a `style` attribute inside every widget frame. A value that could
close its declaration and start another one is refused when the folder is read, and the theme is
listed with the reason instead of being painted.

| Token | Paints |
|---|---|
| `bg` | The page behind the tiles |
| `surface`, `surface-2`, `surface-3` | Tiles, and the two shades above them (fields, keys) |
| `border`, `border-strong` | Separators, and the ones that need to be seen |
| `tile-surface`, `tile-outline` | The card a tile is drawn on. Either may be transparent (`#00000000`): `edge` keeps a surface and drops the outline |
| `text`, `text-muted`, `text-dim` | Body text, secondary text, and the faintest labels |
| `accent`, `accent-hover`, `accent-2` | The accent, its hover, and a quieter second one |
| `on-accent` | Text drawn on the accent |
| `ok`, `warn`, `danger` | The three states |
| `font`, `font-mono` | The two family stacks |
| `fs-xs`, `fs-sm`, `fs-md`, `fs-lg` | The editor's and the navigation bar's type scale |
| `radius-sm`, `radius-md` | Corner radii |
| `shadow`, `ring` | The tile shadow, and the focus ring. `none`, or one or more shadows |
| `text-scale` | How much bigger widgets draw their own text (0.8 to 2) |

### Why `text-scale` rather than a font size

A widget sizes its text from the tile it is given — a clock fills its height, a list counts how
many rows fit — so a theme cannot hand it a size without breaking that arithmetic. It hands it a
multiplier instead: every size a widget computes is multiplied by `var(--text-scale, 1)`, so a
tile that fits at 1 still fits at 1.2, with larger text.

Past roughly 1.3, long labels start to be clipped on small tiles. That is a property of the tile,
not a bug: give the widget another row, or lower the scale.

## What a widget sees

The tokens are custom properties on the widget's own `<html>`, so a widget reads them the way the
dashboard does:

```css
.value { color: var(--text, #e6e8eb); font-size: calc(28px * var(--text-scale, 1)); }
.label { color: var(--text-muted, #8b93a0); font-family: var(--font, -apple-system, system-ui, sans-serif); }
```

Always with the fallback: it is what the widget paints when no theme is applied, and what keeps it
working on its own. A widget that reads none of them keeps its own colours — a theme never forces
anything on it.

Two properties still belong to the tile rather than to the theme, and are painted after it:
`--accent`, when the tile carries an accent colour of its own, and `--on-surface`, the text colour
the host computed for the body it painted. A colour chosen in the editor therefore wins over the
theme, which is what the person setting up that tile expects.

## Tiles without a card

A tile is a card: `tile-surface` painted inside `tile-outline`. A theme that sets both to
`#00000000` draws neither, and its widgets sit straight on the page, separated by the grid gaps
alone. Either one alone works as well — `edge` paints a surface and no outline.

It stays a per-tile decision too: **Background** → **Opacity** in the editor fades one tile,
border included, whatever the theme says, and a background colour set there gives a card back to
a single tile on an otherwise flat screen.

## What a theme does not reach yet

Three kinds of colour in the widgets stay where they are:

- the amber `#f0a020` nine widgets paint their own warnings and rings with, next to the theme
  accent it predates;
- two shades in `claude-sessions` (`#0f1216`, `#3a2f14`);
- brand colours, which should not follow a theme at all.

They read well on a dark theme and are the rough edges of a light one. Moving the first two groups
onto `--accent` and `--bg` is a one-line change per widget, and a visible one under the built-in
theme, so it is left as a decision rather than made here.

The volume widget's knob is a third case, on purpose: its gradients are the material the knob is
made of, not a palette.

## What a theme carries for the registry

`version` is semver, so one release can be told from the next. `author`, `homepage` and `license`
are optional and the dashboard paints none of them — they travel with a theme published beside
the widgets, so it keeps its credit and its terms. `homepage` is https, as the registry index
asks of it:

```json
{
  "id": "nuit",
  "name": { "fr": "Nuit", "en": "Night" },
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Someone",
  "homepage": "https://example.com/nuit",
  "license": "MIT",
  "tokens": { }
}
```

## Themes from the registry

*Admin → **Sietch** → **Themes**.* The same panel the widgets are installed from, the same index,
the same installer: a theme is a package that happens to be the safest one there is.

A card shows the four tokens `accent`, `bg`, `surface` and `text` as a strip of swatches, which is
what you are actually choosing between — so a theme needs no preview image and the card needs no
second request. **There is no consent dialog, and that is the point rather than an omission:** a
theme declares no channels, no commands and no network hosts, so a dialog would be asking you to
approve an empty list. What protects you is the validation — the downloaded `theme.json` is held
to the same `TokensSchema` a theme on your disk is, one expression per token, because these
values end up in a `style` attribute on `<html>` and inside every widget frame.

An installed theme lands in `<dataDir>/themes/<id>/` — never in the checkout, so `git pull` can
neither lose it nor conflict with it — and appears in Screen → Theme straight away. A built-in id
can never be taken: `fremkit` and `edge` are refused by the installer and by the registry alike.

Removing the theme the screen is painted with is refused, naming it, rather than repainting the
dashboard in something nobody chose. Pick another one first.

`nuit`, `brume`, `terminal` and `papier` shipped with Fremkit until they moved there; they are
the same themes, by the same author, at the same version.

## Keeping your own theme

`themes/mine/theme.json` is a file the repository does not know about: pulling never touches it,
and nothing in the app writes to it. Copy `themes/edge/theme.json`, change the values, press ⟳.

To share it, open a pull request on the
[registry](https://github.com/fdussert/fremkit-sietch) — its CONTRIBUTING is the whole procedure,
and it applies the schema below at pull-request time, so you hear about a typo before anyone
installs it.
