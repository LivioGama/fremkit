     Every frame the dashboard and the admin draw is a widget, and a widget is third-party code
     in a sandbox that may still navigate its own frame. Sent anywhere else — `https://…?d=<its
     data>` — the request itself is the leak, whatever the page later does with it. The host
     pages' CSP (`frame-src <origin>/widgets/`) refuses the same thing; this is the web view
     saying it too, so it holds even for a page served without that header.

     `about:blank` and `srcdoc` are refused as well: neither page creates such a frame, and a
     widget's CSP (`frame-src 'none'`) means a widget cannot either.
