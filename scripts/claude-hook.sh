# Claude Code hook: forward the event JSON to Fremkit. Always exits 0; never blocks the session.
# Configure it with "async": true in ~/.claude/settings.json.
#
# The hook runs *inside* the session's environment, which is the only place that knows where that
# session lives: which terminal application owns it, which pane, which tty. Nothing else can find
# out afterwards — the server sees a session id and a working directory, and two sessions in two
# panes of the same folder look identical. So a `client` object is added to the event here.
#
# What is deliberately *not* sent: `ORCA_AGENT_HOOK_ENDPOINT` and `ORCA_AGENT_HOOK_TOKEN`. That
# file holds a token for Orca's own hook receiver, `orca terminal switch` does the job without it,
# and a credential does not belong in an event that ends up in `data/claude-sessions.json`.
#
# jq is not guaranteed on a Mac, so the object is built with printf and merged by hand. Everything
# here is best-effort: any step that fails leaves the event exactly as it arrived.
