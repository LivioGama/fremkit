 * What travels: the live config as the store has migrated it, and the background library. What
 * never travels: the secrets. They live in the macOS keychain, keyed by connection id, and the
 * whole point of putting them there is that a file copied to a USB stick does not carry them.
 *
 * Keyed by connection id, though — and a restore keeps the ids. So on the same Mac the items are
 * still there and the connections work straight away, which is why the answer asks the store which
 * secrets are genuinely absent instead of naming them all. The price of that convenience is that
 * the archive chooses the *fields*, a host among them; `backup/secrets.ts` is what keeps a stored
 * secret from following a connection to a host the archive picked.
