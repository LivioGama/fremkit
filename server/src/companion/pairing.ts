 * the Edge names the code it was shown for, so a request swapped in after the user read the code
 * is never the one refused; a refused request is kept until it expires, two minutes after it was
 * made, so the extension can collect the answer.
 *
 * Requests are counted globally, like wrong pairing codes: an origin is only a name the asker
 * picks, so a per-origin count would limit nothing. The per-install count and the cooldown after a
 * refusal only keep one honest extension from hammering; a local process can pick any install id,
 * and what protects the user is that only the Edge shows the code.
