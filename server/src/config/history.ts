/**
 * A rolling history of the dashboard as it was saved, in `<dataDir>/history/`.
 *
 * Undo in the admin covers one editing session and `fremkit.json.bak` one save. This keeps the
 * versions a person can still want back a week later: a page deleted yesterday, an import that
 * replaced everything, a format upgrade that went wrong.
 *
 * - One snapshot file per entry (`<id>.json`, the config exactly as saved) and one `index.json`
 *   listing the entries with their time, their kind and what changed (`history-diff.ts`). The
 *   index is a cache of the files: when it is missing or unreadable it is rebuilt from them.
 * - Saves are coalesced: an ordinary save less than `coalesceMs` after the start of the entry on
 *   top replaces that entry's snapshot instead of adding one, so continuous editing leaves one
 *   version per window — the last state of the burst.
 * - Nothing coalesces into, or over, an entry of another kind. A restore, an import or a format
 *   upgrade therefore always leaves the version before it in the list, frozen. And when the list
 *   does not end with the state about to be replaced (a fresh install, a first save after this
 *   feature arrived) that state is recorded first, as an `earlier` entry.
 * - Capped by count and by age, whichever bites first. The newest entry is never dropped.
 *
 * Files are 0600 in a 0700 folder like the rest of the data folder. They hold what `fremkit.json`
 * holds, which is no secret: connection secrets live in the keychain (or `secrets.json`) and the
 * config only ever carries a connection's non-secret fields. They are not part of a backup — see
 * `docs/backup.md`.
 *
 * Every failure here is the caller's to log and ignore: the history must never stop a save.
