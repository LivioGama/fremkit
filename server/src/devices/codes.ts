 * Why the /64: inside its own /64 one IPv6 host picks any address it likes (SLAAC privacy
 * addresses, as many as it cares to make), so counting per address would give one machine as
 * many allowances as it wants. The /64 is the smallest prefix a host does not control; the cost
 * is that the IPv6 peers of one segment share an allowance.
 *
 * Why not for link-local (fe80::/10): every link-local address on every link is in the same
 * fe80::/64, so keying it by /64 made one key for the whole network — a single guesser on the
 * link held pairing at 429 for an iPad coming in over link-local IPv6, which is what a `.local`
 * name usually resolves to. Keyed by address, one host can still make several link-local
 * addresses, and what bounds those is the total ceiling, as for IPv4 aliases. (The iPad also tries
 * the Mac's other addresses when one answers 429; see `PairClient`.)
 *
 * Something unreadable is counted under itself.
