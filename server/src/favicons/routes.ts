/**
 * `GET /api/favicon?url=…` — the icon of the site a link button points at.
 *
 * Only the origin of the URL is used, so every button on one site shares a single cached icon
 * and the path (which may carry a token or a private page) never leaves this machine beyond the
 * request the widget already made. A failure answers a bodyless 404: no message that could
 * repeat the URL back to a caller, and nothing is ever logged — including by the request log
 * itself, whose serializer drops the query string (see http/logging.ts).
 *
 * `GET /api/favicon?image=…` is the exception that keeps the whole address: one image the user
 * typed into a widget's settings, for a site whose pages declare no icon of their own. The host
 * page only asks for an address it found in that widget's settings (`useWidgetBridge`).
