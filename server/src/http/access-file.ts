 * Where the access secret is written, and how it gets there.

 * One file per port, in the helper's support folder: `~/Library/Application Support/Fremkit/
 * access-<port>.token`, or under `FREMKIT_SUPPORT_DIR` when that moves the helper's files (a
 * second helper under test). Keyed by port rather than kept in the data folder, because every
 * reader knows the port and nothing else: the Claude Code hook runs from any directory, the
 * helper may find a `pnpm dev` server from another checkout on its port, and the app keeps its
 * data somewhere a checkout does not. Whoever listens on the port owns the file.
 *
 * Mode `0600`, replaced atomically: written to a temporary file in the same folder and renamed
 * over the old one, so a reader sees the previous secret or the new one, never half of either.
