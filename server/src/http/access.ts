/**
 * The local access secret: what a request has to show before the server answers it.
 *
 * The server listens on loopback, and the Host and Origin checks in `guard.ts` stop a web page
 * from talking to it *as itself*. They do not stop a page from embedding or reading something
 * the browser lets through, and they cannot tell one local program from another. The secret
 * narrows "anything that can open a socket to 127.0.0.1" to "whoever can read a file only this
 * user can read": the helper that started the server, the scripts, and a browser that was handed
 * a one-time link by one of those.
 *
 * Two carriers, and nothing else:
 *
 * - `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`, for programs (the helper, the hook scripts, `curl`).
 * - A session cookie, `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Strict`, for the pages. A browser gets it by
 *   following `/auth?code=…`, where the code is single-use, short-lived, and was minted by
 *   someone who already holds the secret; the helper's web views follow the same kind of link.
 *   The cookie holds a session id of its own, random, kept in this process's memory, expiring
 *   and revocable — never the secret. Browsers send a host's cookies to *every* port on that
 *   host, so whatever listens on another loopback port sees the cookie; what it sees is a session
 *   that dies with this process, after a day unused, or after a week at most, and that cannot
 *   mint a code or be presented as a bearer.
 *
 * A few routes are exempt, by route rather than by path text — see `isPublicRoute`.
