/**
 * The gate every HTTP request passes before it reaches a route.
 *
 * Who sent a request is the access secret's business (`access.ts`); this is about where it came
 * from. The server listens on loopback and treats its own origin as trusted.
 * Two browser tricks get around "loopback only" without ever leaving the user's machine, and
 * both are answered here.
 *
 * **DNS rebinding.** A page on `evil.example` gets that name to resolve to `127.0.0.1`, then
 * talks to us with its own origin. The socket is loopback, the origin is the attacker's, and the
 * `Host` header says `evil.example` — which is how we catch it: a request whose `Host` is not
 * one of the loopback names we answer to was not aimed at this server, whatever the packets say.
 *
 * **Cross-site writes.** Any page can `fetch` us with `mode: 'no-cors'` and never read the
 * answer; that is enough to save a config, rescan the widgets or upload a wallpaper. So every
 * request that is not a read must carry an origin we trust.
