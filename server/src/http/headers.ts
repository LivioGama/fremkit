 * Its first job is `frame-src`: a widget frame may navigate itself, and the only place it may go
 * is another widget document (`/widgets/…`, served under the widget CSP with the bridge first).
 * Without it a widget sent its data off in the URL of its own frame (`location = 'https://…?d=…'`),
 * since a sandboxed frame may always navigate itself. The rest is the usual: our own scripts and
 * nothing else, no plugins, no `<base>`, never framed by another page.
 *
 * Written for the origin the page was loaded from — `host` is the request's Host, already checked
 * against the names this server answers to (the loopback gate, or the devices gate on 4243) — so
 * the WebSocket and the widget paths are named exactly, on 4242, a second checkout's port, or
 * `https://<mac>:4243` for a paired device. `ws:`/`wss:` are spelled out rather than left to
 * `'self'`, which older WebKit does not stretch to WebSockets. Vite's dev server serves the same
 * pages in development with its own variant: `ui/vite.config.ts`.
