 * The mirror of `tools/schema.ts` in the registry repository. It is written twice on purpose:
 * this side never trusts the other's description of what it published, and a shared package
 * would make one repository's release schedule the other's problem. `INDEX_SCHEMA` is what holds
 * them together — an index announcing a different number is refused before a single field is
 * read, so a Fremkit too old to understand a future index says so instead of guessing.
 *
 * Everything here is data from the network. Nothing in it is believed: the URLs are checked
 * against the registry's own host before anything is fetched, the hash and the size are verified
 * against the bytes that arrive, and the permissions are re-read from the manifest inside the
 * package rather than taken from the index entry that advertised them.
