/**
 * Talking to the registry: the index, and the packages it names.
 *
 * One registry, named in one place. A second one is a decision nobody has taken, so this is a
 * constant rather than a setting — but the index carries its own `registry` name and every
 * consent record stores it, which is the part that would be expensive to add afterwards.
 *
 * The outbound rules are the project's usual ones, for the usual reason: this is the server
 * fetching a URL on the user's behalf, and the only thing standing between the network and the
 * disk. https only, a timeout on every call, a byte ceiling read as the body streams rather
 * than trusted from `content-length`, no redirect off the registry's own host, and the
 * private-address refusal in case that host ever resolves somewhere it should not.
