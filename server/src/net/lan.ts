/**
 * Whether a peer may talk to the remote listener at all: an address on a local network, or this
 * Mac itself.
 *
 * The listener binds every interface (`::`), because which of them the iPad comes in on — Wi-Fi,
 * Ethernet, IPv4 or IPv6 — is not known in advance and changes with DHCP. What it must not do is
 * answer the rest of the world: a VPN peer, a host on a global IPv6 address, anything a port
 * forward lets in. So the peer's address is judged on the socket, before TLS, and only these
 * ranges pass:
 *
 * - IPv4 private networks, RFC 1918: 10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16;
 * - IPv4 link-local, 169.254/16 (a Mac and an iPad on a cable, or a network with no DHCP);
 * - IPv6 unique local, fc00::/7, and link-local, fe80::/10;
 * - loopback, 127/8 and ::1: the Mac itself, which the tests use;
 * - IPv4-mapped forms of all the IPv4 ones (`::ffff:192.168.1.20`), which is how a dual-stack
 *   socket reports an IPv4 peer.
 *
 * Nothing else carries an IPv4 here: a 6to4 or NAT64 address that *embeds* a private IPv4 still
 * arrives from the internet, so unlike `isPrivateAddress` (which asks where a request would go),
 * this asks where it came from and reads only the mapped form. CGNAT (100.64/10) is refused too:
 * it is a carrier's network, not the user's — and the address a VPN like Tailscale hands out.
 *
 * Pure: the address in, a yes or no out. Anything that does not parse is refused.
