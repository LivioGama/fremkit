 * to a private address — turns the proxy into a way to read this machine's own services: the
 * Fremkit API itself, a printer, a router's admin page, a cloud metadata endpoint.
 *
 * The check runs twice, because either alone can be fooled. The manifest is judged when it is
 * read, which catches the obvious literal; the resolved address is judged at request time, which
 * catches a name that points at 127.0.0.1 today and somewhere else tomorrow. The gap between our
 * lookup and the one `fetch` does (DNS rebinding) is closed by `net/pinned.ts`, whose connection
 * lookup applies `isPrivateAddress` to the very address it connects to.

 * - 6to4, `2002:<ipv4>::/16`, whose second and third groups *are* the tunnel endpoint.
