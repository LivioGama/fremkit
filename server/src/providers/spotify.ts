 * which `Number()` reads as NaN — and a NaN position is a progress bar that never moves. An
 * integer has no separator to get wrong. `duration` is already in milliseconds, and `sound

 * `tell` block a command goes to the target first, so `round` works only where Spotify agrees to
 * load the addition, and one that refuses fails the whole script — a bar stuck at zero would
 * become "Spotify error". An operator never leaves AppleScript. It truncates where `round`
 * rounded, which under a millisecond nothing on the bar can show.
