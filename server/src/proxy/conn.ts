 * and a path; the proxy holds the user's credentials and will make exactly the calls that were
 * shown in the consent dialog, and no others. So the matcher errs towards refusing: it compares
 * segment by segment against a pattern the schema has already vetted, and knows nothing about
 * encodings, case folding or path traversal, because it never sees a path that could carry any
 * of those — `checkPath` refuses those before the match is even attempted.
