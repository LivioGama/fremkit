/**
 * The catalog as the admin and the dashboard read it: the themes, and why a folder was refused.
 * Each theme carries the custom properties it resolves to — layered on the built-in theme here,
 * once, rather than in every client that has to paint them.
 *
 * `inForce` is the theme the `theme` channel would say now (`schedule.ts`). A page paints only
 * once it has the catalog, so carrying it here means the first paint is already the night theme
 * at night, rather than the day's until the socket catches up.
