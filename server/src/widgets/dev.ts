 * Writing a widget: the author's folder, and the watcher that reloads a widget when it is saved.

 * Off unless the server is started with `FREMKIT_WIDGET_DEV=1` (`pnpm dev` exports it). The app
 * never sets it, so a shipped Fremkit neither reads an author's folder nor watches anything.
 *
 * The folder is `<dataDir>/widgets-dev` unless `FREMKIT_WIDGET_DEV_DIR` names another — a clone
 * of the registry's `widgets/`, typically, so the widget is written where its pull request will
 * come from. Not `<dataDir>/widgets`: that one is the marketplace's, written by the installer and
 * by nothing else, and a widget there with no consent record is granted nothing at all. Not the
 * checkout's `widgets/` either: that is the built-ins, and a new widget belongs to the registry.
