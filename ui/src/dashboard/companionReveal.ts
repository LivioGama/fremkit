/**
 * Which page a browser-extension share should bring up on this dashboard.
 *
 * The server stamps each reveal with a `seq`. This dashboard acts on a seq it has not acted on yet:
 * "differs", not "greater", because the counter restarts at 1 when the server does. The first
 * snapshot after (re)subscribing is only recorded, so a reconnect never jumps pages on its own
 * over a share that was revealed earlier: a dashboard that stayed loaded is not moved.
 *
 * A dashboard that has just loaded is another matter (`landingPage`): the kiosk reloads when the
 * server restarts, and a share taken back after that restart is not revealed again (the server
 * counts it as on screen already), so the reloaded page would land on its first page and stay
 * there. Its first snapshot after the load, when it shows a live share, turns to the Fremplay page
 * once.
