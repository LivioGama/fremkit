// Two input paths feed the same `onSwipe` callback:
// - a real pointer drag (down/up, 50px threshold);
// - the touch driver's translation of a finger drag into horizontal wheel
//   events (with momentum), which we accumulate and debounce so a single
//   drag doesn't flip several pages.
//
// The touch driver can emit BOTH a pointer drag and wheel events for the
// same finger drag, and their thresholds can cross at slightly different
// times (and even disagree on direction from residual momentum). A shared
// gesture lock makes only the first trigger count: once either path fires
// a swipe, both paths ignore further triggers for LOCK_MS, so a drag never
// "swipes and immediately comes back".
