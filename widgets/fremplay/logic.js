  /**
   * What the receiver does on a snapshot, given what it holds:

   * is a view sent and not yet seen in the snapshot's `receivers`, `connected` a peer whose
   * connection is up.
   *
   * - `hold`: the snapshot shows no share while this frame's peer is still connected. A server
   *   that restarted says so before the extension comes back with its share, and the picture,
   *   which goes peer to peer, never stopped: keep it, and wait for the peer to die or the share
   *   to come back.
   * - `reset`: the share this frame was on is over or replaced; drop the peer and start over.
   * - `answer`: the offer to answer — this receiver's, and not the one it answered last.
   * - `view`: ask the extension for an offer — on a new share, when the receiver has neither a
   *   pending view nor a peer, or when the server does not list it (it restarted). Not on a
   *   direct switch from one share to another: the session asks every receiver it knows itself.
   * - `refused` (set only when true): the server lists this receiver in `tab.refused`, its offer
   *   named more than this Mac. Nothing is answered or asked: asking again gets the same offer.
   *   The frame says so until the share changes, which clears the list.
   *
   * An offer stays in the snapshot after it was answered, so `lastOffer` is kept across a dead
   * peer and only forgotten with the share: a peer that died is replaced by viewing again, never
   * by answering its stale offer a second time.
